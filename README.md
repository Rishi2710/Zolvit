**Please use the "main.ipynb" for a simpler logic extractor. This is my main code and works extremely well and is optimized with a slightly different logic for MIXED PDF ONLY. The "draft.ipynb" is the code which follows the mixed PDF logic mentioned in the PDF. Please use "main.ipynb" for a fully functional code.**
